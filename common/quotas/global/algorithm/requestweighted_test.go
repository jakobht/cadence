// fairly fuzzy but somewhat representative of expected use:
// benchmark "update a bunch of keys and get my load" requests, and accumulate data across all iterations.
// this is roughly what a server update operation will look like.
// there are intentionally overlaps in both hosts and keys to get multiple hosts per key and updates to existing data.
//
// while this obviously has major caveats and fake costs, the benchmark regularly runs several thousand iterations
// before it settles, filling a moderate amount of data along the way (e.g. consistently all 10k keys, and >200k records in memory).
//
// general results imply:
//   - host-weight reading takes a few times longer than updating, but on my laptop the
//     bench takes about 3-4ms per loop for the current 100/1000/10000 values, without mutexes.
//   - this is relatively CPU costly, but even if our largest cluster checks in every 3s to a *single*
//     host, this should work out with some room to spare... and it will be far more spread
//     out in practice due to the number of history hosts involved.
//   - an attempt to cache weight calculations per key until invalidated saved about 1/2 the cpu
//     with a perfect cache.
//   - ^ the cache seems not worth the complexity, but it'd be fairly easy to add if we change our minds
//
// since there is only a coarse mutex in the implementation itself, the whole aggregator forces itself
// to be processed serially.  if this turns out to be too costly, the easy fix is probably
// to shard the keys to e.g. 8 separate aggregators that can be processed concurrently.
//
// mutexes could be added to each Limit, but that could end up costing more in memory delays
// than the fine-grained locking gains us in concurrency flexibility.  benchmark first!
